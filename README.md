## Standard Users (command line tool)

#### How to Install 
1. Install Node.js 14.1.0+
    - Node is used to execute javascript, which this tool is written in.
    - https://nodejs.org/en/ *(Make sure you click the right version)*
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - On windows, click start & then type cmd. 
3. Type the below command to install the tool. 
    - npm install -g bds-addon-installer

#### How to Use
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
    - on windows, click start & then type cmd
2. Navigate to the folder where your bedrock server is installed. 
    - Example: cd .\Desktop\mcServer\
    - If you need more help it is time to google "how to use command prompt".
3. Run the tool for the first time to create the BDS-Addons folder.
    - Type "bds-addon-installer" without the quotes. 
4. Copy all of your .mcpack & .mcaddon files into the new BDS-Addons folder. 
5. Run the command again to install the packs.
    - Type "bds-addon-installer" without the quotes.

#### Command Options
 - bds-addon-installer <path_to_server> [-v] [-r]
    - path_to_server - *The relative or full path to the root directory of your server.*
    - -r - *Removes all installed packs before installing the packs from BDS-Addons/.*
    - -v - *Enables verbose mode which will log additional details as the script runs.*

#### Notes
 - There are two types of files that this tool can work with. Minecraft packs(.mcpack) which are individual resources, and Minecraft Addons(.mcaddon) which are collections of multiple packs. Minecraft packs will be installed without being altered but the .mcaddon files will be converted into the individual packs it contains before being installed.
    - mySpecialAddon.mcaddon - Converts to ->
        - mySpecialAddon_resource.mcpack
        - mySpecialAddon_behavior.mcpack
 - This tool will check to see if a pack is already installed and up to date. If the new pack has a different version number (even older) it will reinstall the pack. If the versions match nothing will be done.
 - If you want to run a clean installation of all packs you can use the -r option to uninstall all packs before installing those found in the BDS-Addons folder. 
 - If you want to completely remove all packs, empty the BDS-Addons folder before running the tool with the -r option. 
 - Bedrock Dedicated Servers have required vanilla resources pre-installed. These packs are constantly updated by Mojang, making it difficult to implement a system for differentiating them from custom packs. For this reason the tool assumes that the installed world packs and server packs are synchronized. If you manually installed any pack on just the server, bds-addon-installer may have difficulties uninstalling it.
